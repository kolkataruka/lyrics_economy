Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
To take control of my whole body
Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long?
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell
And now my whole week, my whole week is golden
Can you see me glowing? That's how I feel
And I'm not afraid to fade into emotions
'Cause I know that this could be something real

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know
Nigga I'm takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to skrrting out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

When I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
Well, I was younger then, take me back to when
I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
15 years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields
And getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Ceilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

I heard he spent 500 pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, ""Chune, boy, never light up the room""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym, keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave

I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Ceilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine

Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life (than racism in recent years)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin' (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA

It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

To get to you, to get to you

Saw the dark side of the moon
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

An old man said to me, ""Won't see another one""

""The Rare Old Mountain Dew""

And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in 18 to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
I pray God it's our last
I could have been someone
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit

River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)

Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (you know?)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (together), fuck up clubs together (together)
And we'd both go crazy (crazy) if we was to sever

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
Well, little one (I'm sorry)

And when you get to topping
I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping
You spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block, like you Jenny

See you later
Gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I can get used to this
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me, you know where I'll be
I'll be riding shotgun
Underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
The South of the Equator, navigator
Deep sea diving round the clock
Bikini bottoms, Lager tops
We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailing along
And we don't look back

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (vroom!)
This is payback in a way (yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (what?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about
An evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me, I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (yuh)
You might'a went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (bup)
Shut your mouth better, faggot
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die, I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (vroom!)
This is payback in a way (yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (what?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about
An evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me, I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

At this age, how are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on the girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating
I came in, 550 on trainers
Island girl amazing, could be Bajan, Trini or Haitian
She got a bag with flowers
If the trainers match I'll take it
Me and bro just shut down Gucci
Had the whole of the shop floor waiting
Who's that girl in the line
With the big behind that's looking all tempting?
If her friend is a dead ting
Take one for the team with a bredrin
Two peng tings at the entrance
Want attention but a man can't let them
She must think I'm a reverend
You ain't coming here getting redemption, no way
I see dem man skating now, I'm talking about running their legs
My youngens in country plugging the Z
He can't even buck me till nothing is left
I flooded my right, I flooded my left
I'm ducking your wife, I'm ducking the feds
The bell on the trap, it's buzzing again
But still I ain't trying to get busted by feds
Look man I ain't caught the bus in a sec'
It's me and my rambo cutting through West
The way that I went and just flooded my neck
I'm shocked that I ain't gotta struggle for breath
With me and the missus be going on dates
She's holding the dipper, I'm holding her waist
Just see some pigs moving low in the mains
So I phone up my nigga and told him the plate
Tell a peng girl you can HMU
I don't wanna cuddle and H-U-G
And I'm still shopping in HMV
For all of my niggas in HMP
Heard you got a girl going DMU
If I DM'd you would she DM me?
Young black brudda I'm a stylish g
Man I put the IC in IC3
They tell me I'm gifted in rap
Nothing was nice, used to live in the trap
Now if I go ask that chick for her snap
I can bet money she's giving me that
I'm always in Harrods, I'm filling the bag
Them niggas ain't winners, them niggas are mad
Gyal at my vids and them bitches are bad
They get picked in the foreigns and ditched in the cab

We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
The bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life, ohh
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun
Feed the world
Let them know...

Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell

Distorted self image, we set up to fail

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Couple figures, killers call and collect
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat
Roll with us if you really wanna get it
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper
I got the hookup and there's really no limit
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

Savage love (685, baby)
If I woke up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
Every night and every day (every day)
I try to make you stay
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
You could use me
Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
You got a way of making me spend up all my cash
(Ooh-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la)

I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her girl you cute but balling, that shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the god is

Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
Sure it's Christmas once more

Don't wanna, but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose
Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off with someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna, but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose
Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off with someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys
""Fuck the Patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer, and we'd swear
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say, ""All's well that ends well"" but I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy ever, lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
You, that's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning 21""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things, and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold, I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolin'
You will get a sentimental feelin'
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly"" (ooh)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

OG so proud of me that he choking up while he making toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)

Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)
Say your time is coming soon, but just like Oklahoma (mm)
Mine is coming sooner (mm), I'm just a late bloomer (mm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here getting cuter (woo)

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell

With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you, ""Be of good cheer!""
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
