[00:14.62]When I was running from my brother and his friends
[00:21.73]And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
[00:29.14]Well, I was younger then, take me back to when
[00:34.54]I found my heart and broke it here
[00:39.22]Made friends and lost them through the years

[00:21.43]So let the river run
[00:22.67]He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
[00:25.27]Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
[00:27.85]On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
[00:29.76]And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
[00:32.56]It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
[00:35.56]She's kept track of all his Internet chats
[00:37.86]And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
[00:40.43]Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
[00:43.89]'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
[00:46.53]And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
[00:49.25]But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
[00:51.94]Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
[00:54.78]So she's been on the web lately
[00:56.73]Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
[01:00.02]And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
[01:03.14]Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""

[01:28.09]So let the river run
[01:29.31]One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
[01:31.43]It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
[01:33.97]He found out, now she feels deserted and used
[01:36.85]'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
[01:39.52]Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
[01:42.22]It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
[01:44.98]Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
[01:47.09]Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
[01:50.20]So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
[01:53.43]Don't have to be reserved in a booth
[01:55.66]I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
[01:58.06]Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
[02:00.79]And now that I got you I don't want you
[02:02.42]Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
[02:04.38]Why do I do this dirt that I do?
[02:06.18]Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
[02:08.76]Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
[02:10.83]'Cause now with her in the womb

[02:16.67]Fuck!

[02:54.65]And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
[02:57.47]Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
[03:00.27]That's why I may have came at you sideways
[03:02.74]I can't keep my lies straight
[03:04.57]But I made you terminate my baby
[03:07.07]This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
[03:09.78]What else can I say? It was fun for a while
[03:12.13]Bet I really woulda loved your smile
[03:14.13]Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it

[00:35.56]She's kept track of all his Internet chats
[00:37.86]And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
[00:40.43]Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
[00:43.89]'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
[00:46.53]And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
[00:49.25]But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
[00:51.94]Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
[00:54.78]So she's been on the web lately
[00:56.73]Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man

[01:31.43]It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
[01:33.97]He found out, now she feels deserted and used
[01:36.85]'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
[01:39.52]Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
[01:42.22]It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue

[03:03.13]But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
[03:05.24]That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
[03:07.74]But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
[03:09.51]Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
[03:11.16]And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
[03:12.68]But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
[03:14.36]On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'

[03:42.31]Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
[03:43.98]Been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
[03:45.53]From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
[03:47.18]Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
[03:48.71]That they say as a writer might've fell off
[03:50.34]I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
[03:51.92]So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move

[00:25.76]The air was cold
[00:28.26]But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
[00:32.41]And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
[00:37.70]And you've still got it in your drawer even now
[00:53.43]Oh, your sweet disposition
[00:56.32]And my wide-eyed gaze
[00:58.97]We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
[01:04.42]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
[01:08.63]And I can picture it after all these days
[01:14.35]And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
[01:19.73]And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
[01:30.19]'Cause there we are again on that little town street
[01:35.09]You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
[01:39.69]Wind in my hair, I was there
[01:42.36]I remember it all too well
[01:50.26]Photo album on the counter
[01:53.03]Your cheeks were turning red
[01:55.34]You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
[02:00.84]And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
[02:05.92]You told me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
[02:10.67]And you were tossing me the car keys
[02:13.68]""Fuck the Patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
[02:17.40]We were always skipping town
[02:20.84]And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
[02:25.50]He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
[02:31.07]'Til we were dead and gone and buried
[02:34.27]Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
[02:38.47]After three months in the grave
[02:41.57]And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
[02:46.13]But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame
[02:52.00]And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
[02:57.63]And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
[03:07.80]'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
[03:12.92]We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[03:17.73]Down the stairs, I was there
[03:20.24]I remember it all too well
[03:28.64]And there we are again when nobody had to know
[03:33.61]You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
[03:38.46]Sacred prayer, and we'd swear
[03:40.98]To remember it all too well, yeah
[04:03.86]Well, maybe we got lost in translation
[04:07.29]Maybe I asked for too much
[04:09.37]But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
[04:14.65]Running scared, I was there
[04:17.18]I remember it all too well
[04:24.84]And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
[04:30.52]So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[04:35.12]I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
[04:39.48]'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[04:52.84]You double-cross my mind
[04:56.27]You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
[05:03.25]And that made me want to die
[05:06.84]The idea you had of me, who was she?
[05:09.40]A never-needy ever, lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
[05:17.16]Not weeping in a party bathroom
[05:19.51]Some actress asking me what happened
[05:22.47]You, that's what happened, you
[05:27.24]You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
[05:32.78]Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
[05:37.21]But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
[05:42.44]And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning 21""
[06:01.02]Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[06:06.21]I'd like to be my old self again
[06:08.86]But I'm still trying to find it
[06:11.16]After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
[06:16.25]Now you mail back my things, and I walk home alone
[06:21.61]But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
[06:26.47]'Cause it reminds you of innocence
[06:29.32]And it smells like me
[06:31.59]You can't get rid of it
[06:33.93]'Cause you remember it all too well
[06:42.12]'Cause there we are again when I loved you so

[07:21.72]And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
[07:27.80]""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
[07:33.39]From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
[07:38.26]I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
[07:43.56]And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
[07:48.74]Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
