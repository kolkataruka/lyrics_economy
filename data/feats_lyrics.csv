[02:20.83]You got a couple of ghostwriters
[02:22.34]But to these kids, it don't actually matter
[02:23.83]They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
[02:25.69]I said, ""I don't have any answers""
[02:26.79]'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
[02:28.39]It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (yeah)
[02:30.06]And actually comin' from humble beginnings

[02:34.34]We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
[02:35.84]But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
[02:38.02]To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
[02:39.97]The inability to pen humility
[02:41.48]Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
[02:43.10]Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?

[02:52.17]Wreak havoc on tape decks (woo)
[02:53.33]ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
[02:55.10]We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
[02:57.23]'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
[02:59.10]All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
[03:01.52]I don't hate trap (nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
[03:03.13]But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
[03:05.24]That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
[03:07.74]But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
[03:09.51]Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
[03:11.16]And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
[03:12.68]But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
[03:14.36]On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
[03:15.69]Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
[03:17.28]I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about
[03:18.76]An evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
[03:20.39]'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
[03:22.14]Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
[03:23.42]It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
[03:24.92]And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
[03:26.88]Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
[03:28.07]You could never say to me, I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
[03:29.74]I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
[03:31.26]Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
[03:33.15]Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
[03:35.14]I got spite inside my DNA (yeah)
[03:36.60]But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
[03:39.96]It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
[03:42.31]Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
[03:43.98]Been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
[03:45.53]From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
[03:47.18]Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
[03:48.71]That they say as a writer might've fell off
[03:50.34]I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
[03:51.92]So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
[03:55.21]Give me some room (woo!), give me some room (hey!), give me the juice
[03:58.46]Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot

[00:25.76]The air was cold
[00:28.26]But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
[00:32.41]And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
[00:37.70]And you've still got it in your drawer even now
[00:53.43]Oh, your sweet disposition
[00:56.32]And my wide-eyed gaze
[00:58.97]We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
[01:04.42]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
[01:08.63]And I can picture it after all these days
[01:14.35]And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
[01:19.73]And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
[01:30.19]'Cause there we are again on that little town street
[01:35.09]You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
[01:39.69]Wind in my hair, I was there
[01:42.36]I remember it all too well
[01:50.26]Photo album on the counter
[01:53.03]Your cheeks were turning red
[01:55.34]You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
[02:00.84]And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
[02:05.92]You told me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
[02:10.67]And you were tossing me the car keys
[02:13.68]""Fuck the Patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
[02:17.40]We were always skipping town
[02:20.84]And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
[02:25.50]He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
[02:31.07]'Til we were dead and gone and buried
[02:34.27]Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
[02:38.47]After three months in the grave
[02:41.57]And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
[02:46.13]But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame
[02:52.00]And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
[02:57.63]And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
[03:07.80]'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
[03:12.92]We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[03:17.73]Down the stairs, I was there
[03:20.24]I remember it all too well
[03:28.64]And there we are again when nobody had to know
[03:33.61]You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
[03:38.46]Sacred prayer, and we'd swear
[03:40.98]To remember it all too well, yeah
[04:03.86]Well, maybe we got lost in translation
[04:07.29]Maybe I asked for too much
[04:09.37]But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
[04:14.65]Running scared, I was there
[04:17.18]I remember it all too well
[04:24.84]And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
[04:30.52]So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[04:35.12]I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
[04:39.48]'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[04:45.78]They say, ""All's well that ends well"" but I'm in a new hell every time
[04:52.84]You double-cross my mind
[04:56.27]You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
[05:03.25]And that made me want to die
[05:06.84]The idea you had of me, who was she?
[05:09.40]A never-needy ever, lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
[05:17.16]Not weeping in a party bathroom
[05:19.51]Some actress asking me what happened
[05:22.47]You, that's what happened, you
[05:27.24]You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
[05:32.78]Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
[05:37.21]But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
[05:42.44]And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning 21""
[06:01.02]Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[06:06.21]I'd like to be my old self again
[06:08.86]But I'm still trying to find it
[06:11.16]After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
[06:16.25]Now you mail back my things, and I walk home alone
[06:21.61]But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
[06:26.47]'Cause it reminds you of innocence
[06:29.32]And it smells like me
[06:31.59]You can't get rid of it
[06:33.93]'Cause you remember it all too well
[06:42.12]'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
[06:47.57]Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

[07:12.62]It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
[07:21.72]And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
[07:27.80]""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
[07:33.39]From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
[07:38.26]I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
[07:43.56]And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
[07:48.74]Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
[07:53.91]'Cause in this city's barren cold, I still remember the first fall of snow
[08:02.97]And how it glistened as it fell
